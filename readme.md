# JNode
Welcome to the JNode repository. JNode is a simple NodeJS framework created to make working with NodeJS easier and to give you way more, and more powerful, control. With JNode you're servers will be easier to setup and thereby you'll loose less time. JNode is build on top of Express some other dependecies for extra features. Talking about features:
<br><br>

## Features
- **API**: JNode uses API controllers that can be inserted from the main file. You don't need to use some type of casing to point JNode to your controller, you can just insert a method and you're done.
- **Views**: We call .html file views, views can be loaded from the view folder and will be routed to the specified URL. By the way, all the folder names can be changed, so don't worry about using our casing.
- **Assets**: JNode doesn't only route the assets for you, it will also cache making your website much faster.
- **Data**: Instead of writing a whole database driver by yourself, we already did that for you. You can use our abstract data layer to easily get data from the database to your liking.
- And there is lots and lots more to explore and hopefully optimize your NodeJS usage...
